# Machine Learning Processing

I am working on some machine learning examples for Processing.  I would like to make a machine learning library for Processing to use with my Nature of Code book.  Things I am looking into:

* Processing / Java
  * [weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/weka/)
  * [neuroph](http://neuroph.sourceforge.net/)
  * [deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/)
* p5.js / JS
  * [tensor flow playground?](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground/blob/master/src/nn.ts)
  * [convnetjs](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/)
Updates made at tensorflow:
